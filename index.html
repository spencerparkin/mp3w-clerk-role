		<h1>Mueller Park 3rd Ward Clerk</h1>
		<p>
		This page is a living document.  The purpose is to rigorously, consicely, and continously redefine
		the role (or calling) that is the Ward Clerk for the <a href="https://www.mpstake.com/3rd-ward">Mueller Park 3rd Ward</a>.  It is
		based upon the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook?lang=eng">General Handbook</a> and the unique needs of the ward as determined by the
		bishop.  Absolutely no confidential information is presented here.
		</p>

		</p>
		<h2>General Responsibilities</h2>
		<p>
		Generally, the ward clerk's role is to off-load administrative tasks from the bishopric as much as possible
		so that they can focus primarily on the ministrative tasks of caring for the ward.
		Many tasks are peformed through <a href="https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng">LCR</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>Daily Responsibilities</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Check LCR for pending action items (e.g., uploaded photo approval.)  Take action as necessary.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Weekly Responsibilities</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
			On Sunday, attend Ward Council meeting, take notes, especially action items.
			</li>
			<li>
			On Sunday, discretely and inconspicously take attendance in Sacrament meeting.  Record the result in LCR.  (This may need to be combined with web-cam attendance as reported by the web-cam manager.)
			</li>
			<li>
			Mid-week, send a list of follow-up items to the Ward Executive Secretary.  At his discretion, these can be used to help drive the agenda for the next Ward Council meeting.
			</li>
			<li>
			On Sunday, after all meetings, send an inquery to the bishopric requesting info about who was set apart.  Note that knowing who has been released, called or sustained is easily gleaned from meetings.  Update the state of all callings for ward members in LCR.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Quarterly Responsibilities</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Prepare and submit the quarterly report to church head-quarters when due.  Organization leaders may need to be contacted to help complete the report.  Note that they input data through LCR which, in turn, automatically shows up on the report.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Semi-Annual Responsibilities</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Perform the semi-annual membership record audit, then report the result to church head-quarters.  I'm still not sure how to research information for this, but it is done through LCR.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Occasional Responsibilities</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Respond directly to requests from ward members to have their records updated for accuracy.  Note that proof and authorization is needed in some cases before a change can be made.</li>
			<li>Respond directly to requests from ward members to make purchases for needed supplies (e.g., baptismal rings, etc.)  May need to coordinate with the finance clerk to ensure there is room in the budget.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Deligated Responsibilities</h2>
		<p>
		Two assistents to the ward clerk have been called to share in the responsibilities of ward clerk.
		<h3>Assistent Ward Clerk -- Finance</h3>
		<p>
		A lot of research is still needed here.  My understanding is too limited at this time.
		</p>
		<h3>Assistent Ward Clerk -- Membership Records</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Record ward member ordinances in LCR for such things as baby blessings, baptisms, confirmations,
			and priesthood ordinations.
				<ol>
					<li>Prepare the ordinance form and then give it to the bishop.</li>
					<li>Upon completion of the ordinance, obtain the completed form from the bishop.</li>
					<li>Use the ordinance form to record the ordinance in LCR for church record keeping.</li>
					<li>Prepare a certificate of the ordinance, signed by the bishop, and present it to the ward member for their personal records.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
			Arrange for a ward member to give the opening prayer each week in Sacrament meeting.  Likewise for the closing prayer.
			</li>
			<li>
			Some sort of record adjustment needs to happen when a ward member passes away.  I am unclear on this.
			</li>
			<li>
			When a ward member moves out of the ward, send their membership records to the new ward.  This can be done through LCR.  Special cases exists (e.g., out of unit records are sometimes created.)
			</li>
			<li>
			Monitor LCR for membership records that newly arrive in our ward.  This can be done through LCR.  LCR does not seem to have an automatic notification feature for this, but a report can be generated to find recently added membership records.
			</li>
			<li>
			Create new records for babies born in the ward.  Once born, babies become members of record, not
			to be confused with members of the church.  Membership in the church occurs at or after the age
			of accountability, once baptized and confirmed.
			</li>
		</ol>
