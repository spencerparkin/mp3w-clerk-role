		<h1>Mueller Park 3rd Ward Clerk</h1>
		<p>
		Last updated: March 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2025
		</p>
		<p>
		The purpose of this page is to consicely define
		the role (or calling) that is the Ward Clerk for the <a href="https://www.mpstake.com/3rd-ward">Mueller Park 3rd Ward</a>.  It is revised as needed to keep it up-to-date, and is based upon the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook?lang=eng">General Handbook</a>
		and the unique needs of the ward as determined by the bishop.
		Absolutely no confidential information is presented here.

		</p>
		<h2>General Responsibilities</h2>
		<p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Generally, the ward clerk's role is to off-load administrative tasks from the bishopric as much as possible
			so that they can focus primarily on the ministrative tasks of caring for the ward.
			Many tasks are peformed through <a href="https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng">LCR</a>.
			The bishop or any of his councilers may, at any time, make a request of the ward clerk that isn't necessarily
			accomplished using LCR.
			</li>
			<li>
			The ability to complete some reports and audits may depend on personal knowledge of various ward members.  Since I'm quite anti-social, this may require a probing of bishopric brains.
			</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		<h2>Daily Responsibilities</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Check LCR for pending action items (e.g., uploaded photo approval.)  Take action as necessary.</li>
			<li>For photo approval, see the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/tools/help/photo-upload-guidelines?lang=eng">photo upload guidlines</a>.  I have had to reject a few photos, not becaue they were bad in any way, but because they simply didn't meet the church guidelines.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Weekly Responsibilities</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
			On Sunday, attend ward council meeting, take notes, especially action items.
			</li>
			<li>
			On Sunday, discretely and inconspicously take attendance in Sacrament meeting.  Record the result in LCR.  (This may need to be combined with web-cam attendance as reported by the web-cam manager.)  Starting the count after the Sacrament ordinance usually works well, but be sure to check the program the day-of (things can change last minute), because you do <i>not</i> want to start your count and then have, for example, the choir leave their seats to go up to the front in the middle of your count.
			</li>
			<li>
			Mid-week, or whenever, respond to the Ward Executive Secretary's query for items to be included
			in the up-coming Sunday's ward council meeting.  These are follow-up items you took
			notes on in last Sunday's meeting.
			</li>
			<li>
			Update the state of all callings for ward members in LCR records.
				<ol>
					<li>
					Update calling status of ward members in LCR, but only once sustained.  Note that some calling status changes don't require sustainment, because the change is from, for example, one part of Primary to another.  They are already called and set-apart in that case, so just update the info in the database.
					</li>
					<li>
					On Sunday, after all meetings, if applicable, send an inquery to the bishopric requesting info about who was set apart.  Note that knowing who has been released, called or sustained is easily gleaned from meetings.  (The bishopric may be too busy to respond to this inquery, so if you can find out another way, that's helpful.)
						<ol>
							<li><b>Called</b> -- A calling has been extended and excepted.</li>
							<li><b>Sustained</b> -- The calling was announced and ratified by the congregation.</li>
							<li><b>Set Apart</b> -- The priesthood was used to place the calling mantel upon the individual called.</li>
							<li><b>Released</b> -- The calling mantel has been removed by anouncement.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
					If all else fails, just try to keep the calling status of all ward members as accurate as you can, whether the changes are done at the right time or not, because a person's calling status in the system determines what permissions they have within the system.  It's better to be too early than late, I suppose.  Also, if it's just too hard to know if someone has been set apart, maybe don't worry about it.  The calling status is the most important.  I suppose you could always contact an individual and ask them directly.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
			Arrange for a ward member to give the opening prayer each week in Sacrament meeting.  Likewise for the closing prayer.
				<ol>
					<li>
					I keep a personal record containing each ward member and the date they last prayed in church.  I find this very helpful when trying to decide who to ask.  My record is in JSON format, so I can easily run a query against it using a Python script.
					</li>
					<li>
					I have never tried asking someone over text, e-mail, or phone.  I have always done it face-to-face, and I'll bet that this gives much better results.  It's harder for people to say no.  I am always sure to emphasize that they don't have to do it, but that it would be nice if they would.  The best time to ask is during church the Sunday prior to the Sunday when they would be giving a prayer.  Do not ask them the day of, if possible.
					</li>
					<li>
					Report to the bishopric and the person whose calling it is to prepare the ward program the people I've gotten to commit to giving the prayers for the next week.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Quarterly Responsibilities</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Prepare and submit the quarterly report to church head-quarters when due.  Organization leaders may need to be contacted to help complete the report.  Note that they input data through LCR which, in turn, automatically shows up on the report.
				<ol>
					<li>
					I'm guessing that traditionally the Ward Clerk would have gathered information from organization leaders to complete the report, but this is no longer necessary as they each input their numbers into the system from whence the report is generated.
					</li>
					<li>
					I may need to contact or follow-up with an organization leader to complete their numbers if vacant or if they look wrong for some reason.
					</li>
					<li>
					After a final review between the bishop and I, the report is submitted.  I'm not sure what else to say about the report at this time.  There were some yes/no questions on the report that I had to research, but that's about it.  The rest of the information was pre-populated by the system somehow.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Semi-Annual Responsibilities</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Perform the semi-annual membership record audit, then report the result to church head-quarters.  This is done through LCR.  To complete the audit, the brains of the bishopric must be used, so set aside time to meet with them in person at a computer.  If they don't have all the answers, then I suppose you'd have to make plans to reach out to other people.
				<ol>
					<li>
					The main purpose of this is to make sure that the records are a reflection of reality.  For
					example, the bishop might interview a young man, find him worthy, and perform an ordinance
					for his advancement in the priesthood, but forget to submit paperwork for it, and so it
					doesn't get recorded.  I've seen it happen, and an audit can catch these kinds of mistakes.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Occasional Responsibilities</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Respond directly to requests from ward members to have their records updated for accuracy.  Note that proof and authorization is needed in some cases before a change can be made.</li>
			<li>Respond directly to requests from ward members to make purchases for needed supplies (e.g., baptismal rings, etc.)  May need to coordinate with the finance clerk to ensure there is room in the budget.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Deligated Responsibilities</h2>
		<p>
		Two assistents to the ward clerk have been called to share in the responsibilities of ward clerk.
		As ward clerk, I have to have at least some basic understanding of what they do, because it would be
		my job to do it if they were ever out sick or released.  And, supposedly, it's actually my responsibility,
		but just being deligated to them for the time being.
		</p>
		<p>
		My job is really to support them in their role however I can.  (See <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/20?lang=eng">Matthew 20:27</a>.)
		</p>
		<h3>Assistent Ward Clerk -- Finance</h3>
		<p>
		This area of responsibility is the most fuzzy to me.  I won't understand it better unless I'm ever tasked with doing any of it.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Balance the ward budget.  (Easier said than done.  I have no idea how to do that.)  Note that one year's surplus carries over to the next year, and this is even planned for as a way of preparing for a large expendature in a future year (e.g., girls camp.)
			</li>
			<li>
			Collect and deposit donations and tithing.  This must be done with a bishopric member present.
			Most tithes and offerings are given electronically by church members, so there may not be much to do here.
			</li>
			<li>
			Handle reimbursements to ward members who use their own money for church-related purchases.
			</li>
			<li>
			Perform a bi-annual financial audit with the stake financial clerk.  I have no idea what this involves.
			Clearly, though, this is to reduce errors and prevent fraud.
			</li>
			<li>
			Handle the authorized use of charitable givings toward the needs of ward members.  The bishopric
			determines if and how such givings are used, and makes a plan with those in need so that they do
			not become dependent on the help being given.  I co-authorize the use of the funds, print the check,
			and mail it if necessary.  Such funds are never given to individuals.  Rather, they are paid directly
			to third parties or for food or other types of needed supplies.  Of course, such cases are to
			remain confidential.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Assistent Ward Clerk -- Membership Records</h3>
		<p>
		I'm guessing a lot here, becaue I don't know how to do this job.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Record ward member ordinances in LCR for such things as baby blessings, baptisms, confirmations,
			and priesthood ordinations.
				<ol>
					<li>Prepare the ordinance form and then give it to the bishop.</li>
					<li>Upon completion of the ordinance, obtain the completed form from the bishop.</li>
					<li>Use the ordinance form to record the ordinance in LCR for church record keeping.</li>
					<li>Prepare a certificate of the ordinance, signed by the bishop, and present it to the ward member for their personal records.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
			Some sort of record adjustment needs to happen when a ward member passes away.  I am unclear on this.
			</li>
			<li>
			When a ward member moves out of the ward, send their membership records to the new ward.  This can be done through LCR.  Special cases exists (e.g., out of unit records are sometimes created.)
			</li>
			<li>
			Monitor LCR for membership records that newly arrive in our ward.  This can be done through LCR.
			An automated notification, of sorts, for this exists in LCR as a tile you can setup on your dashboard.
			</li>
			<li>
			Create new records for babies born in the ward.  Once born, babies become members of record, not
			to be confused with members of the church.  Membership in the church occurs at or after the age
			of accountability, once baptized and confirmed.
			</li>
		</ol>
